# Portfolio_10_PDF_to_Audiobook

## Tenth (10) Portfolio Project - Converting a PDF to Audiobook

## This program will use the PyPDF2 to read a PDF file
## Then it uses AWS Polly to convert the PDF to speech

### Keep in mind you have to use your own AWS account to access polly
### There are quotas and limits to Polly so don't do long strings.
### I am including a converted string and original pdf.
### I have only converted first 1000 characters due to quotas and limits.
